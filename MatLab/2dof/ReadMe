ReadMe: To launch the Simulink template files
Reference variables used for input parameters:
F = frame length, L1 = length of link1, L2 = length of link2.
    1. Download and clone the template (.sltx ) file in a new folder.
    2. Create a new project and save the template file in it.

    3. Double click on the template file to launch it.




    4. When it is your first launch an error saying missing data file appears.



    5. Go to the 2dof subsystem and click on one of the revolute joints.




    6. Fix the error by choosing appropriate data file present inside the same folder.









7) Once the error is fixed the model should look something like this without any blocks highlighted in red.


8) Run the simulation and feel free to play with the input values for different joint angles and profiles.
