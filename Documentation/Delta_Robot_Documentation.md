## Parallel Robots
A Parallel Robot refers to a kinematic chain in which a fixed platform and moving platform are connected to each other by several serial Kinematic chains.

## Delta Robots
Delta Robot is a type of Parallel Robot consisting of 3 identical Kinematics chains connected to a Base, The key design feature of Delta Robots are the use of Parallelograms in the arms
which restrict the movement of the base/end plate to pure translation( i.e. Only movement in X,Y or Z direction) 
Delta Robots are known for it's high speed and high acceleration, Also having all the kinematic chains connected together to end-effector increases stiffness of the robot.
